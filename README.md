# OpenHospital
Open Hospital is a project for designing a large hospital complex. Intented for people who are interested in hospital design and exploring large medical complexes.

Its intention is to design a hospital that could have existed from 1900s to the 2000s before either becoming abandoned or still open. This hospital would be its own self sustaining complex in terms of power generation, water processing and laundry. Ideally this project could house up to 1,500 patients.

The design of the hospital should include a big main building that has connection corridors and looks very interesting from an arial view. I'll be contributing to this project as well!
